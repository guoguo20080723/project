## Dataset
Web scraping is a method to extract data from websites. Here I use web scraping to get the titles, topics, and published time of all the news including remarks, articles, presidential actions, and briefings and statements on the whitehouse.gov website from January 20, 2017 to April 25, 2020.

## Analysis
Text analysis is to model and structure the text information for data analysis. Here I use Tf-idf to analyze word frequency by topic, bigram analysis to explore relationships between words, and Latent Dirichlet allocation (topic model) to classify the content into different groups.
